## Introduction

This project is written by OpenGL.

It's made for the Introduction to Computer Science presentation.

We reproduce the IBL(Image-Based Lighting) and SDFSS(Signed Distance Field Soft Shadow).

Also, the branch `earth` renders high-resolution earth and moon, and the branch 'Phong' reproduce the Phong Lighting Model.

## Using

Run `main.cpp`.
